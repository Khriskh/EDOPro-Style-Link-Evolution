## All platforms
After following your platform-specific instructions, clone the repository and open it in Git Bash. Initialize all submodules. Obtain [Premake5](https://premake.github.io/download.html) and extract it to this folder, or place it in `PATH` if you know what that means.

Quickstart (set your platform name appropriately):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/edo9300/ygopro.git edopro
cd edopro
git submodule update --init --recursive
./travis/install-premake5.sh windows|linux|osx
```

## Windows
- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (this also comes with [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) if you prefer
- [Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) 2015 Update 3 or newer, with Visual C++ support installed
- OPTIONAL: [DirectX 9 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=6812)
  - If you get error S1023 when installing this, go to Control Panel > Uninstall a program, uninstall all versions of Visual C++ 2010, and try again

Restart your computer after installing Visual Studio or DirectX SDK.

## Linux
Obtain the following from your package manager if you don't have them already:
- Git
- Curl
- GCC
- 7-Zip
- Unzip
- Tar

For example, on Debian-based distributions: 
```bash
sudo apt install git curl build-essential p7zip-full unzip tar -y
```

## macOS
Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): 
```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
This will also install Xcode Command-Line Tools.

```
brew install dylibbundler gpatch p7zip
```

If you plan to build all your dependencies locally instead of retrieving them from cache, also install Xcode from the App Store now.
