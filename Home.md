EDOPro is one of the bleeding-edge forks of the [YGOPro client](https://github.com/Fluorohydride/ygopro), which is powered by [YGOPro core](https://github.com/Fluorohydride/ygopro-core), an automated scripting engine for the Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game.

Due to many recent changes in this client and its [core](https://github.com/edo9300/ygopro-core), it is incompatible with any other simulator not based off this fork.

This project is maintained by edo9300, DyXel, and kevinlul. Reach out to edo9300#9332 or DyXel#0161 on Discord to work with us and contribute! We welcome all support and contributions.

To build the entire client for yourself, follow the numbered steps in the sidebar.
