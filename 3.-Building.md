If you installed Premake to `PATH`, no need for `./`

Windows (replace `*` with `2015`, `2017`, or `2019` for your Visual Studio):
```bash
./premake5 vs*
```
If you did not install DirectX 9, add `--no-direct3d` to use OpenGL bindings.

Open `./build/ygo.sln` in Visual Studio and build from the IDE!

Linux and macOS:
```bash
./premake5 gmake2 --vcpkg-root=YOUR_VCPKG_FOLDER_IF_USED_ON_LINUX
make -Cbuild -j2
```
`config=debug` is the default and `config=release` is supported. Build targets are `ocgcore`, `ocgcoreshared`, `clzma`, `ygopro`, and `ygoprodll`.

Premake-generated project files are in `build`. Built object files are in `obj` and final binaries are in the corresponding `bin` folder depending on configuration. Remove these folders to start a totally clean build, especially if you changed your project files via Premake, as Visual Studio and Make's clean command might not catch everything.
