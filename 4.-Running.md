The built binaries fail to start without some needed assets. To obtain them quickly, do `./travis/quickrun.sh debug|release` depending on your build config on Windows and Linux. This copies and downloads some sample resources if they aren't already in `bin`.

The required assets are `system.conf`, `strings.conf`, `cards.cdb`, the font file specified by `system.conf`, and the irrKlang shared library. Textures, sounds, and irrKlang plugins are technically optional.

On macOS, the binary needs to be bundled. If you are lazy, you can run the same script and then move the generated binary to a subfolder, and it should be able to run. However, it's recommended to do the following instead.

```bash
./travis/predeploy.sh
```
On all platforms, this copies final built binaries to `deploy`, without any assets, and strips debug information from release binaries. Do `export BUILD_CONFIG=debug` to copy debug binaries instead of release binaries. On macOS, this also creates portable app bundles for the built binaries, so they can be run on double-click, without expecting dynamic libraries in `/usr/local/lib`.
